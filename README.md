# Kingsway Academy — Simple Website (with logo)

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/logo.png  <-- place the logo image here

How to preview:
1. Create a folder for the project.
2. Save the three files above and create an `assets/` folder.
3. Save the provided logo image (Image 1) as `assets/logo.png`.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Customize:
- Update the phone/address in the Visit section.
- Replace hero placeholder with a real photo of the field or courts.
- Change colors in `styles.css` :root variables (`--primary`, `--accent`) if desired.

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Commit these files to your repository's `main` branch.
2. In GitHub -> Settings -> Pages, set Source to `main` / `/ (root)`.
3. The site will publish at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

If you want, I can:
- Replace the hero placeholder with school photos (you can upload them or give links).
- Adjust color shades to exactly match your logo (I can sample exact hex from your image).
- Create a ready-to-push commit and push these files to your GitHub repo (I can prepare the commit; tell me the branch).
```
